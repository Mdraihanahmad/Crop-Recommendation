CROP RECOMMENDATION REPORT
================================
Recommended Crop: Muskmelon
Muskmelon is the best crop to be cultivated right there

Technical Summary: Muskmelon fits because K, ph align with its profile; consider adjusting N, P, temperature, rainfall.
Farmer Friendly: Crop is suitable. Good: potassium, soil pH. Needs attention: nitrogen, phosphorus, temperature, rainfall.

Input Values:
  - Nitrogen (N): 50.0
  - Phosphorus (P): 40.0
  - Potassium (K): 50.0
  - Temperature (Â°C): 27.1
  - Humidity (%): 91.0
  - Soil pH: 6.5
  - Rainfall (mm): 0.9

  - P: value=40.0 mean=17.72 z=3.1 assess=outside typical range
  - K: value=50.0 mean=50.08 z=-0.02 assess=within typical range
  - temperature: value=27.1 mean=28.66 z=-1.81 assess=outside typical range
  - humidity: value=91.0 mean=92.34 z=-0.89 assess=slightly different
  - ph: value=6.5 mean=6.36 z=0.61 assess=within typical range
  - rainfall: value=0.9 mean=24.69 z=-8.58 assess=outside typical range

Suggestions:
  - Improve nitrogen conditions.
  - Improve phosphorus conditions.
  - Consider waiting for a few warmer/cooler days if possible.
  - Plan irrigation or drainage depending on expected rain.
